Traffic flow prediction is an essential part of the intelligent transport system. Traveling can be 
safer, more economical, and less congested with the help of traffic forecasting research. 
Although classic models make use of shallow networks, the number of cars has grown 
exponentially in recent years, making traditional machine learning techniques inapplicable to 
present situations. This is a precise projection of the volume of traffic in a specific area at a 
specific future period. Various machine learning and deep learning models such as Support 
Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN) will be explored for their suitability in predicting traffic flow patterns. The 
latest deep learning models developed to tackle this very problem are reviewed and due to the 
complexity of transport networks, this review gives the reader information about how various 
factors influence these models and what models work best in different scenarios. Multilayer 
Perceptron (MLP) Regressor is a versatile and powerful algorithm for regression tasks, capable 
of learning complex nonlinear relationships in the data. With its multilayer architecture, 
backpropagation training algorithm, and diverse activation functions, MLP Regressors can 
model intricate patterns and make accurate predictions across various domains. By tuning 
hyperparameters, optimizing training procedures, and leveraging deep learning frameworks, 
practitioners can harness the full potential of MLP Regressors to solve real-world regression 
problems effectively.
